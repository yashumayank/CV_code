# Bachelors, Masters and PhD projects
This is a dummy repo with some of the projects from my Bachelors, Masters and PhD studies. Most of the code in this repo should be easy to compile or run directly except the code thtat uses depricated platforms such as Adobe Flash and directX9. The Adobe flash platform was discontinued this year, however the code should be easily portable to Adobe Animate.
