# Bachelors, Masters and PhD projects
This is a dummy repo with some of the projects from my Bachelors, Masters and PhD studies. Most of the code in this repo should be easy to compile or run directly except for the codes that use depricated platforms such as Adobe Flash and directX9. The Adobe flash platform was discontinued in year 2021, however the code should be  portable to Adobe Animate.
