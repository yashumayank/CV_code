An engine for first person 3D free view built using directX9 and C++. Something similar to counterstrike after death vision. DirectX 9 is now deprecated, so both the SDK and the runtime libraries will have to be seperately installed and activated. Alternatively, the code can be ported to use the latest directX libraries.
