I wrote the first draft of these programs during my master's thesis under supervision of Siv Andersson and Lionel Guy. These scripts have been updated further during my PhD and were use to validate the genome assemblies published by Mahajan et al. 2020. Together these script query the sam files, and then summarize and visualize the mapping qualiy of the good paired reads from different multiple sequencing libraries. Contrary to the available tools our goal was to account for the whole sequence between the properly mapped pairs of the paired end reads.
