I wrote the first draft of these scripts during my master's thesis under supervision of Siv Andersson and Lionel Guy. These scripts have been updated further during my PhD and were also used to validate the genome assemblies published by Mahajan et al. 2020. These scripts can be used to summarize and visualize the mapping qualiy of the good paired reads from different multiple sequencing libraries.

The first step is the "assembly_validation.pl" script that calculates the coverage and insert size of the mapped read from multiple libraries at each base. The currently available methods show only the ends of the mapped paired end reads. Contrary to the available tools our goal was to account for the whole sequence, including the nucleotide sequence in-between the properly mapped paired end reads. As described in the help message, this tool needs a pileup file produced by merging all the mapped sequencing libraries. The output of this script is tab file with the coverage and insert size statistics for each base.

The output from the first step, "assembly_validation.pl" can then be used as an input to the Assembly_graph_v2.R and summarizeValidation.0.3.R. The uploaded version of these scripts can be used to plot read mapping data from 2 different paired end libraries. The sample output from these two scripts is shown.

Output from Assembly_graph_v2.R:
